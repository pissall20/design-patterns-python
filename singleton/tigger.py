Refactor the Tigger class into a Singleton following these steps in the tigger module:

1)  Make the Tigger class private by appending to its name a single leading underscore.

2)  Create a private module-scoped variable called _instance and initialize it with None.

3)  Define a function called Tigger that takes no arguments. This function is responsible for creating an instance of the _Tigger class only once and returning a reference to this unique instance every time it gets called. To accomplish this youâ€™ll need to use the _instance variable from the previous point.
